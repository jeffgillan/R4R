Conda and Pip are two things that are very new to me. I suffer a great deal regarding version control and probably thats a reason I feel that a huge volume of my Bachelor level work lacks repeatability in terms of research data particularly. Now, these are challenging for me to follow at times. But I feel at least in the case of text data- this will be a game-changer for me. Along with the tools that are being used here in the FOSS sessions and R4R platforms, I found a couple of Data Management Environments for Architects managing visual data. Newforma is one of them and I found that Asana has features that helps with "task management" part of work too. Though this knowledge base extends towards "project management" than conventional work of architects- I feel as a researcher, these are crcial knowledge to have.

Before diving into the Conda Tutorial we talked a bit about "Automation" which I feel is crucial for the research I do. I am working towards process automation as the core focus of my research. The things we talked about here like validating data or software management- sometimes can be repeatative and can be automated. I recently initiated a research information management platform for young architects from Bangladesh conducting researcha work from all over the world. I created a Discord server and working on a Git based data system for them to communicate and share their open source works. Its on it's very first step and I already automated the mail invite system using "Mail Merge". That is the beginning but I feel for me, this idea of automating certain parts of the process is pivotal to my research and I will keep harnessing this as I move forward to the fullest.

I am suffering immensely to set up my Cyverse account. Everytime I am lead to a landing page- it is not responsive somehow. I followed portion of the tutorial creating a shell environment in my computer. But having cyverse access would have helped me save the progress at one place which I could not do in the last class. But as there is a step by step tutorial in the resource platform- as soon as I get access, I aim to repeat the tutorial as a whole

#**Note:**
I am talking to my supervisor regarding a talk on "Data Management for Architects: Research, Design and Beyond" in mid-November. I have a conference from 10/31-11/05 in Mexico City. After I come back, the date needs to be fixed. Also, I feel we should meet the data science ambassedors at this point to get an idea about what to do with the knowledge we are having from FOSS and R4R beyond this semester.
