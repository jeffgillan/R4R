## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
Last session made me realized that issues I deal with in my research are very relevant in the context of open science. Specifically, I had a chance to discuss problems related to the restrictions of sharing the data when the it was collected on the private property or with collaboration with private entity (in my example, it is a mining company). Also, good points were brought out regarding storing the data and making sense of the data after certain amount of time. I think this is a good reason to create readme file about every project so that anyone (including myself) can get back to this project later on. Also, I am very glad to get to know about CyVerse storage space. 

### Bud: 
I definitely plan to transfer my data for archiving purposes to CyVerse platform. I am finishing up my first paper and about to decide where to store the data and the code and this could be an additional place where this could be stored. Also, for my ongoing projects, it would definitely make more sense to use CyVerse space instead of google drive/box space. 

### Thorn: 
I am looking forward to learn about project management. For GitHub, I learned from Jeff how to import a repository (clone from other peopel's GitHub) but I am struggling to find an option to import single files from one repo to another. 

## Additional thought
Great lessons so far!
