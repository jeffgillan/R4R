# Learner Log Entry #4 

### Rose/Bud:
Project management is a topic that I know about the least, so this session was really helpful in learning all of the terminology and how to make a project management plan. I may not have an immediate use for something 
like a project management plan now, but it will be useful in my postdoc and later in my career. I also did not know the term "research object", so I learned that it's important to share something like code that is
understandable to the user. I want to put a lot more effort in organizing my research software now that I've learned this, so I created a website about it at https://sdmitrovic.github.io/ISARA/. Right now, it's simply 
a black and white website with some introductory information, but I will provide a detailed guide on installation and how to use the software (with a link to the software). 

### Thorn: 
Since this is my first website, I still have a lot of learning to do on how to make it look nicer (learning HTML?), adding hyperlinks, etc. Also, I mentioned that I want to develop an application for my software. 
However, this seems like a very daunting task and have no idea where to start. Executing a sound project management plan is a lot of work instead of just giving a link to the code, but I'm excited for the eventual 
end product for ISARA.
