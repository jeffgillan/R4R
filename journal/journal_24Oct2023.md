Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:

I learnt about Conda and Nextflow. I knew about conda but I have never used it. I use pip most of the times and requirements.txt file for dependency managment. I knew about the virtual environment, I use pipenv/virtualenv for that. Also, sometimes just docker will all the dependency. Dependency mgt is a big issue with python, if you use Java or Scala etc. then you don't face these type of issues.  Another tool that I will recommend for python dependency management is [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). 

### Bud: 

During my work experience I have faced the package dependency issue a lot. I started using pip and requiememnts.txt, it helped a lot. I am already using that in my current research project. I have used [airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) for workflow management, but that will be very heavy for my current project. So, I am thinking of using Nextflow.

### Thorn: 

I think people should learn more about debugging of dependency mgt.
