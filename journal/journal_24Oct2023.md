# Learner Log Entry #7

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
Watching problem-solving on the fly was helpful because it shows how one could go about solving dependency problems, teaches independent problem-solving which is a very needed skill

### Bud: 
Looking forward to learning about containers

### Thorn: 
Issues encountered with repeatability just underscore for me, the importance that researchers actually know what their code is doing, the package that calculates a certain result might break or change but the math shouldn't change.
We should be documenting our methods more thoroughly in addition to striving for better code repeatability.

## Additional thought
Curious about how conda works in the broader computer structure. For some reason I can't compile FORTRAN code if I have conda installed.
