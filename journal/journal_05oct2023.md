## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
I enjoyed the discussion, and also getting know about the ways to communicate science. For example, I wasn't familiar with the problem with twitter and didn't know about bluesky. The tutorial on creating a webpage similar to FOSS course was great. I think I will create a workshop webpage like this for my CyVerse presentation. It is a nice alternative to what I am used to. I used to creat classic html/css/bootstrap pages using githbup pages. 

### Bud: 
I would like to try using bookdown and some other tools that were presented for document management. Since I am going to create an interactive database to store my data and make them accisible, I am planning on using ShinyApp and publish the app using posit connect. I have created a ShinyApp in the past but didn't figure out how to link it to the repo and the way how to update the database.

### Thorn: 
I was suggested to check SQL for database development. I need to explor that further and it will for sure take some time since I don't have experience with SQL (or mySQL?)
