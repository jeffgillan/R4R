## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
I’m excited to learn about .gitignore. I used to have separate folders, one for data and one for git repo, to avoid pushing large files to GitHub. 


### Bud: 
I also find it helpful to learn about some useful features of GitHub on project management. Especially Organization feature sounds very useful when we have a large research group in the future.



### Thorn: 
I haven’t got many thoughts on version control as of now. I expect I’ll encounter more issues as I use it more. But one thing I’d like to learn is how one can edit a commit (like adding or deleting changes) that has been pushed to GitHub and what a ‘force push’ is.
