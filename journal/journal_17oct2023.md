# Learner Log Entry #6 

### Rose/Bud:
I really enjoyed learning how to use Git and GitHub through Jason Williams' lesson. I learned that I should be more specific in my commit messages because if I go back to a code 
6 months from now, I won't remember why I made those changes. It was also interesting to see how to go back to previous versions of your files. I knew this was the benefit of version 
control, but I never actually knew how to go back to an old version. I plan to transition into using Git instead of just using GitHub Desktop and take more advantage of Git's 
capabilities for my research. Although I'm the only one who makes changes to my repos currently, I know that I will have to collaborate with others through Git eventually.

### Thorn:
I need more explanation of why we use gitignore files. I understand how to implement them, but I'm not sure why they would be useful in my own repos.

Going back to the website topic, I would like to learn how to put custom themes and logos on my website. I tried downloading a custom theme and editing my mkdocs file, but it
didn't work for some reason.
