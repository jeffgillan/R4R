## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
For me, it was very interesting to get a general view of the different tools we will be using, especially since I am quite new and not familiar with some of the terms, I am looking forward to learning  how I can implement them to strengthen my research.

### Bud: 
As I mentioned, being pretty new to using these tools, I am looking forward to getting more familiar with the language and options available by watching some tutorials online so that I can be better prepared at the time of the sessions.

### Thorn: 
I struggled to follow up when getting to the Linux WSL, mostly because I could not get it to open on my computer, which made me fall behind a bit; however, the option to have the meetings recorded allows me to go back and look deeper into any missed information


## Additional thought
I appreciated the time Michele took to define, for example, what HackMD is and particularlly the time to explain the general basic terms for us to use the Linux subsystem
