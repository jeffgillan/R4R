### Rose:
Was able to set up and run docker on my local machine

### Bud: 
Looking forward to container camp :)

### Thorn: 
Couldn't build and run an image of a pyhthon script I have already writtem and would like to eventually containerize

## Additional thought
For the amount of work a small research group would be doing, is there any benefit to paid version of docker hub in your opinion?
