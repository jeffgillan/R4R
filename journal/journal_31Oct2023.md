### Rose:

Codespaces was something new to me. In some of my courses, docker is used for assignments. I knew about docker before. But the foss session was a good refresher. May be we should add docker-compose as well in the course. if you want to run multiple containers for e.g. one for python application and one for some database Then docker-compose is useful.  

### Bud: 

In my current project,  I have used poetry for python dependency management but I have not used docker. I will add the docker to make the code more reproducible. 

### Thorn: 

docker is an advance concept, people should do more hands-on and also learn how to debu the container issues
