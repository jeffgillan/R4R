### Rose:
It was interesting to learn how to manage projects and conduct collaborative work using Git. I picked up a few initial steps from Jeffrey Sandstorm during R workshops some time ago, but this presentation expanded on that knowledge. I'll try to experiment with it on my own.

### Bud: 
I am planning to attend a workshop on SQLite and learn how to create, manage, deploy content, and modify my plant database. At the same time, I intend to upload my ShinyApp to Posit Connect and see how it functions. The app isn't finished yet, and I'm still searching for effective and straightforward ways to present data to a broad audience (both scientific and non-scientific). I am thinking of using plotly for some heatmaps and scatterplots. 

### Thorn:
