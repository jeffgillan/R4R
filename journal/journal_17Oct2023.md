### Rose:

I really like how git and github was explained. Sometimes it's very hard to explain these type of concepts to non-computer background audience. I have used git and github a lot. All of my previous companies use github except one which was using Bitbucket. But that's very similar to github, it's just atlassian's github.  I did not know about Git Large File Storage, that was nice to know  


### Bud: 

I am already using github in my research jobs. All the code and sometimes data as well is put into github repo. I  share my code and execution instructions  via github to other colleagues rather than emails. Earlier people were using just google colab. But, it was very difficult to manage multiple notebooks. I started maintainig the code in the github repo, now everyone uses that. I would like to try Git Large File Storage, that's something new for me. 


### Thorn: 

I think people needs more hands-on on git and github. More practice can help people in getting required expertise atleast for their day-to-day work.
