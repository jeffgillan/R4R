# Learner Log Entry #7 

### Rose/Bud:
This was one of the lessons I was most looking forward to because I plan to create a containerized application for my research software. This seems like the best
approach for my project because it is a community software that needs to be run on any type of computer. Ideally, the app would launch into a webpage, but I can 
see this being slow because you need ~90 gb of files to run the code. I'm definitely open to ideas on how to get started and would probably benefit from a one-on-one 
session at some point.

### Thorn:
Using Docker and GitHub Codespaces was pretty straightforward to follow, so I now have a basic understanding of how to use them. However, the hard part is actually 
delving into how to use these tools and creating the application. It seems difficult to turn the code I already have into an app. Is it that I turn the Python code 
itself into a Docker image somehow? As seen in that question, I'm still not clear on the process of going from a set of Python code to a container I can launch.
