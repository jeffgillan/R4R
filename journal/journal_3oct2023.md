### Rose:
I’ve never thought about project management in research projects. I find it particularly interesting to think about different roles in a research project. Also, one project that I’m currently working on is moving toward the step where we create research object to share data to the public, so I hope I can implement the good practice to increase accessibility.


### Bud: 
Many of my projects so far has been single-authored work by myself or involves at most two people, so I wonder for an individual work, how valuable would a project management plan be? 


### Thorn: 
As discussed in the breakout room, it can be difficult to bring up the practice of good project management when someone newly joins a poorly managed project where others have been there for long.
