Indeed, the last session was very interesting because we had hands-on practice, which greatly enhanced our learning. Observing the process of building a website was enlightening. Although it was my initial attempt, it was successful. The webpage currently consists of a single page, but it's a good beginning. I plan to expand it by adding more content soon.

### Bud: 
It would be fascinating to delve deeper into website creation, understanding aspects like adding videos and GIFs or embedding animations on a page. It would also be beneficial to learn about other programming languages useful for web development. For instance, I recall Jeff had a distinct approach to his website. Exploring his methodology could be insightful.

### Thorn: 
I'm looking to challenge myself by updating my research group's webpage.

## Additional thought
I need to move some data from UofA HPC to Cyverse. What's the quickest method for the transfer?
