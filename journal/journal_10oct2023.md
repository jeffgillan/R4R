# Learner Log Entry #5

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
I find it very useful to go through the steps to create Github pages one by one. The structure with MkDocs is easy to use and keep track of. I'd like to explore more on how to customize the website.


### Bud: 
I find it interesting to learn about many different public repositories for documentation and external communication. I expect myself to engage more in creating documentation on public repositories but external communication seems to be a much further step for me. 


### Thorn: 
It would be great if we had more time for the Github page tutorials, especially some time for troubleshooting. I had errors during the tutorial and was only able to get the website launched when I followed the recording afterwards.


## Additional thought
This week’s discussion made me look back on what tools I’ve used to communicate with others. I find Discord particularly useful for managing a large class, where the ticket bot is a very efficient way to communicate with individual students (compared to emails).
