# Learner Log Entry #5 

### Rose:
I never really thought about the communication side of science other than conference talks or paper writing. For instance, I don't usually associate social media like Twitter (X?) with academia, but it seems like a good way to stay connected with other researchers.
I also liked the idea of creating a personal website and/or a blog as a more modern way of sharing your qualifications and research. I enjoy writing quite a bit, so I would want to integrate that into my research other than manuscript writing. My research is important 
for issues that affect everyone like climate change and air quality, which is why I want to explore something like creating a blog or even a podcast eventually. 

### Bud/Thorn: 
I think my reseach group can do more in terms of sharing our research to the public, which ties into my rose. We do outreach to some local middle schools, but it would be good to share on social media the impact of our work. This is especially important because I've seen 
misinformation spread about aerosols and climate change (https://twitter.com/MattGertz/status/1666791080258334723?s=20). Taking a lead on sharing our aerosol research would reduce this misinformation and maybe spark some change in science/climate change policy. This is 
definitely not an easy task and seems daunting, but it is essential for tackling these urgent issues. 

P.S. A fun (and maybe controversial) fact is that my lab uses Skype to communicate, but it's actually quite convenient for us.
