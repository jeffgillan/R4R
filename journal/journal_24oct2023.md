# Learner Log Entry #6 

### Rose/Bud:
I'm excited to use conda environments. I've used Anaconda and installed packages with conda in the past, but I had no idea you could create environments with conda.
For a research project that I'm helping on, another group member and I ran into an issue of running our Python code on different machines. The code worked on my 
computer while it didn't run on her's at all. I could explore conda environments to fix this issue. 

### Thorn:
Sometimes, it's hard to fully automate the code I'm writing because flight data has its own specific quirks. It's easier for me to manually correct data that I need
to record rather than fully automate the code. For example, I can notice by eye if the wind speed value I extract is in the correct flight path ("leg") or not. 
If someone were to take over my project, this method would not be reproducible at all. Therefore, I need to find a way to write code that extracts data fully 
automatically.
