## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The tutorial was useful in guiding us to set up and document our own environment. I also find ‘tree’ very convenient when we want to take a quick look at the folder structure. 


### Bud: 
I look forward to the next topic on containers very much. I encountered a situation where I ran the same code, using the same data and the same software but got different estimates from the ones obtained by a collaborator. We first thought we were doing some steps wrongly but figured out that it was just caused by different versions of the software (standard edition vs the fastest edition).  So, I can imagine being able to run codes using the same environment can save a lot of energy and time!


### Thorn: 
I couldn’t create a git repo in _/home/user/work/home/ytyeh/folder_ (in data store; ytyeh is my username). It returned an error message: “error: unable to write symref for HEAD: Remote I/O error” when I tried to run git init or git clone. I could create one under _/home/user/work_ though. I wonder what was causing the error and whether there is a way to create git repo in folders data store.
