## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
It was my first time to learn about metadata and I found a detailed metadata can be very helpful in informing what the data is about. I also learned from the breakout room discussion about how people organize their data. I’ve never created any list of all the data I use. I think making an excel sheet or a google drive document is a clever idea and I would like to try it out soon.

### Bud: 
I would like to learn more about how to write a complete but not too lengthy data management plan, probably through reading others’ data management plans or begin to write one myself.  I would also like to try to use the data stewardship wizard.

### Thorn: 
As mentioned above, I still don’t have a clear idea on how detailed we should write in the data management plan. Also, documenting data well seems to be a non-negligible commitment before starting any project. I feel it would be difficult for people to implement without enough incentives.
