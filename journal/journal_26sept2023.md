# Learner Log Entry #3 

### Rose:
I really enjoyed Wade Bishop's presentation and learned a lot about good data management practices. I've heard of FAIR, but I've actually never heard about CARE before. Although I'm working with some of these concepts now,
these principles will be especially important for my postdoc (I will be trained to promote open and FAIR practices for field campaign data from aircraft and satellites). This session helped me with learning the definitions 
of these various terms, but now I really have to think of how to apply FAIR principles in a meaningful way to the data sets I will work with.

### Bud: 
I can do a better job of organizing my data files on my local machine. Even though I have labeled folders, knowing which data files I'm working with relies a lot on memory. This will not be helpful once I graduate and someone
else needs to understand what data I'm using. I would like to talk more in the discussion section about better ways to organize files on my machine. 

### Thorn: 
Typically, scientists at other agencies like NASA or the Office of Naval Research collect the data for me and then I analyze it. However, I mentioned last week that these data sometimes aren't standardized or have vague metadata. 
The thorn is that other than downloading and organizing this files on my machine, I don't really have a say on how these files are produced. I can occasionally email the data PIs to make a quick adjustment, but I don't have the
power to make significant recommendations regarding the data.
