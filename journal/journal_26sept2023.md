# Learner Log Entry #3

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
I'm writing a postdoc proposal to NSF right now which requires a data management plan so this lesson was very well-timed and helpful

### Bud: 
Excited to learn how to use the tools in Cyverse to improve my data-processing pipileine, so I can better manage not just my data but my code too for better reproducibility

### Thorn: 
Making a DMP and following through on it seems like a lot of work but I wonder if AI tools like chatpgt can help with it

## Additional thought
Related to using Cyverse, and cloud computing: it there an easy way to pull files from other databases on the internet (like weather station data from NOAA), directly analyse those, and then save the results without actually moving the data files?
