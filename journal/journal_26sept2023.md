### Rose:

I did not know about DMP or FAIR earlier. Now , I know that tt's really important to know about these. I have worked on collecting corpora for one of the research project but, I did not have any DMP. I think if I will make one then it will make future students' life easy.

### Bud: 

I did not know the details about the difference between different liceses. I will look into that further.


### Thorn: 
Not anything like that as of now.
