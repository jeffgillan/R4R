# Learner Log Entry #1 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The last session was very interesting and incredibaly importnant for the scientific community. Although I was familiar with some open science principles, I learned a lot new things. In particular, I got familiar with different types of open science schools, the ethics of using/creating preprints.  

### Bud: 
I would like to work on exploring more GitHub options. I still would like to test the collaborative options. Also, I would like to test zenodo and protocols.io platforms to archive my data upon publishing my paper I am currently working on. This way, I would like to contribute to open science by sharing my datasets, code and protocols.    

### Thorn: 
I tried to clone (copy) the repo for the last homework onto my GitHub, but it seems cloning is reserved for folders on the local machine or those meant to be copied to the local machine. I couldn't figure out how to copy the repo without forking it, so I eventually downloaded the files and uploaded them to my new repo.

## Additional thought
I am looking forward to the presentation on the practical use of the aforementioned tools and software.
