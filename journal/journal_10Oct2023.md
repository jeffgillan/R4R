### Rose:

I learnt about how to create doi of a github repo using [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). This is very useful. I will be graduating in december and I have to prepare the documentation of all the scripts that I have developed in the last 1 year. One good thing is everything is in github repo. 
I did know about mkdocs before, I have used it in my previous company to create the python documentation for one of the project. Also, I did create a website of a NLP tutorial for one of my course. It is live at [tutorials](https://pal0064.github.io/tutorials/)

### Bud: 

I need to check with my professor If I can create the public documentation website using mkdocs of the private repos.
If it's allowed then I will do it using mkdocs otherwise, I will use github wiki. 
I suggested slack/discord to the team for communication, but everyone is not in favor of that. Mostly, we do it over email or sometimes whatsapp  

### Thorn: 

I did not face any challenges in creating website using mkdocs. But, I think rather than doing all of these steps manually, we can easily automate most of the parts, that would make it more easier for other people.
