# Learner Log Entry #5

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
Great to see how to build a website. I've already built mine but it gives me ideas on how I can improve mine or new features I can add to it, especially if I want to host a shiny app or something.

### Bud: 
Would be interesting to see an example of how documentation and communication methods are establish in collaborative research. For example, a project with an academic hydrologist working with municipal water managers, do they have a memorandum of agreement that sets out documentation and communication expectations or another type of document or is it more informal? With collaborative research it's interesting to think about who gets to decide these things.

### Thorn: 
This is probably outside of the scope of FOSS but it would be interesting to have more discussion about collaborative research with stake-holders and rights-holders, co-production of data/knowledge, and how then that relates to the different existing infrastructures of data management/storage.

## Additional thought
I have an R package I'm working on that needs to be tested on a PC and Mac. Is there a way to do that in Cyverse, emulating the different operating systems?
