# Learner Log Entry #1 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
I found the figure from Sahneh & Balk et al. (2020) very informative as well as the use of Governance Document. I am sure that if I happen to have a bigger project in future, I will create a Governance Document as well as the management plan.  

### Bud: 
There's many tools and websites provided in this course but I would really like to see how I can use them effectively for research/ project management. I really enjoyed the first lesson where I could practice navigating through WSL together with a group. Also, it would be interesting to discuss with the group how others manage their projects, what tools they implemented (from and outside the course) and what works best for them. For example, we implemented Sharepoint as document management software, and to reduce the use of gmail, we used microsoft planner for important lab announcements and other schedules. We once used Kanban in the lab and it didn't work out well. I heard some research groups use scrum system but I have never been a part of such environment. Also, it would be great to learn where other folks store the data. Example from my practices - I have my account synchronized with one drive, and if I got my laptop stolen, every file I create is available in the cloud. 

### Thorn: 
I have a little problem understanding how to prepare a bash script for the creation of a working directory. I think this is a great idea to have the common folder structure for each project. 

## Additional thought
I would like to elaborate on one of my project goals, which is creating an open access database that includes the list of plant species with their corresponding elemental composition and soil characteristics + some metadata. I plan such database to be more than just archiving the data. The database will serve as the guidence for phytoremediation operations for mining companies (e.g., using plant seeds for revegetation selecting from metal tolerant plant species). I am actively looking for ideas on how to set up such database, how to maintain it and modify. I initially used ShinyApp, but I am unsure how I could publish the app and make real time edits so I gave up.
