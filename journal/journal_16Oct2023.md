# Learner Log Entry #6

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
Jason's overview on git was very informative and comprehensive. I've only ever used git to push updates to my github repositories but never for offline version control.

### Bud: 
The software carpentry tutorial/how-to guide was really clean and easy to follow, excited to see what other resources they have.

### Thorn: 
Like all things, related to coding or otherwise, I'm going to need more practice with git and find a place for it in my workflow, using it everyday for it to stick ðŸ™ƒ

## Additional thought
This probably already exists somewhere in the cyverse learning materials, but what are other recommended groups writing guides like the software carpentry?
