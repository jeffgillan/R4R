# Learner Log Entry #4

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
Learned I had already been using an agile project management methodology, giving me vocabulary I need to improve my project management 

### Bud: 
Looking forward to streamlining my current way of managing my multiple projects. Right now all my work progress tracking documents are scatttered and not very cohesive

### Thorn: 
This lesson just underscored for me how much work the PhD is and how may different hats we have to wear, often with very little training for being effective in those roles

## Additional thought
Good information for team-based project management but I'm still curious about project management methodologies that would be best for a PhD student working more alone on a project
