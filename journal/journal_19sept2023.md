# Learner Log Entry #2 

### Rose:
I didn't realize the extent that open science is being promoted by researchers in various fields. All of the perspectives that I've heard in the FOSS lesson motivates me to implement open science practices in my own research.
I am also interested in teaching other scientists and/or students about concepts related to open data and open-source software.

### Bud: 
I would like to motivate my lab group to have shared repositories for code and documentation/lab procedures. We have a shared research drive, but not everyone updates it all the time and it's a bit difficult to access.
I think some of the tools from FOSS can be helpful in promoting a easy-access, centralized repository for research group materials. 

### Thorn: 
I think one challenge relates to my research group sharing code and lab documentation. We do an okay job, but I find our research drive a little inconvenient to access and there is no version control present.
Another challenge could be meaningfully implementing open data practices in my research. For example, NASA's flight data is already shared on a public archive, but variable names are not standardized between 
flight years or there is insufficient/unclear metadata to actually make sense of the variables. I am attempting to create netCDF flight files that more closely follow Climate and Forecasting (CF) conventions 
(http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.10/cf-conventions.html), but there is still work to be done in terms of promoting more rigorous metadata standards.
