## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

I have never systematically learned or thought about what Open Science stands for so I enjoyed learning to think about it using the Six Pillars. I would like to begin to think about the FAIR & CARE principles before I use any data. I think they are very important and should be acknowledged by every data user.


### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

I would like to explore more about  the preprints and open peer review, but I haven’t found much in the field of economics. Also, regarding Open Data, my department is thinking about having a shared data pool for the department, but we don’t have a good idea on what is the easiest way to share and store data. 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

I think overall, the concepts of Open Science is very new to me since I don’t see many applications implementing many of its aspect in the field of economics. I think Open Data is especially difficult for economic research because great publications usually have micro-level proprietary data that is not allowed to be shared. Data collection group wouldn’t have incentive to collect these data once they are made free.



## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

I should check the Open Educational Resources when I am in need of programming help in the future. I was never aware of many great websites shared in the lectures.
