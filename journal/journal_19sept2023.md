# Learner Log Entry #2

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
Happy to see the CARE principles alongside the FAIR principles

### Bud: 
Excited to get some help and more guidance on how I can use available tools to re-organize some research projects so that they're more open

### Thorn: 
I'm wondering about ways to encourage more 'buy-in' to open science practices since the tools are out there but not everyone does it

## Additional thought
I'd like to learn how to get a workflow set for my research projects, specifically, how to streamline code for data analysis. I jump around from scripts in R, MATLAB, and python for my data processing.
